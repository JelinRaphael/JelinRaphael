Hi! I’m @JelinRaphael

Who am I? 
Well, a person who thinks that's a question best left to the philosphers.  
(Maybe you'd find luck asking Aristotle.  He seems to have an opinion on everything these days.)

I'm currently interested in computational astrophysics and am hoping to get involved in projects that help showcase the full span of the field and its scope.

Well, mostly.  
In equal portions, this site looks really cool and I want to explore it inside out.

You can reach me at jelinraphaelakkara@gmail.com
